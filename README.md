A struct to be used by [FluxorExplorerInterceptor](https://github.com/FluxorOrg/FluxorExplorerInterceptor) to send the dispatched `Action`, the old state and the new state, to [FluxorExplorer](https://github.com/FluxorOrg/FluxorExplorer).

## ðŸ¤” When should I use FluxorExplorerSnapshot?
You should never have to use FluxorExplorerSnapshot directly. [FluxorExplorerInterceptor](https://github.com/FluxorOrg/FluxorExplorerInterceptor) uses it to encode the data intercepted from the `Store` to send it to [FluxorExplorer](https://github.com/FluxorOrg/FluxorExplorer) which would decode it and show it.
